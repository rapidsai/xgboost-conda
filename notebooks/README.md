# XGBoost Notebooks
## Intro
These notebooks provide examples of how to use XGBoost.  These notebooks are designed to be self-contained with the `runtime` version of the [RAPIDS Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapidsai/rapidsai/) and [RAPIDS Nightly Docker Containers](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapidsai/rapidsai-nightly) and can run on air-gapped systems.  You can quickly get this container using the install guide from the [RAPIDS.ai Getting Started page](https://rapids.ai/start.html#get-rapids)
